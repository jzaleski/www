              the "Scrum of Scrums" was born. This meeting included both business stake-holders and

              As the team grew in size, and more specifically specialized, it became difficult for
              engineers to have a pulse on what each team was working on. Knowledge sharing and
              Transparency are very important to me as a leader, so after hearing this feedback
              first-hand from a number of reports and reports of reports the Weekly Update (e-mail
              summary) and Monthly Platform Meeting (in-person update) were created.

              Criticals Rotation. This concept pre-dates my arrival, but it became immediately
              apparent that it needed an overhaul. During my tenure we switched this from an e-mail
              list to a Kanban queue, got to the root-causes and made fixes to many of the
              underlying issues. I felt strong about having every Engineer on the team in the

              opportunity that retrospectives and post-mortems provide was missed / not part of the
